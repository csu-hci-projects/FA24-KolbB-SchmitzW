In order to run this project we will be using Unreal Engine and the Meta Quest 3.

- "myVRGun" actor (UI to show ammo, stops shooting when out of ammo, delayed reload function with sound)
- "WinLevel" level (with static meshes, spatial text)
- "myTarget" actor (with material change on hit, health, event dispatch to level blueprint)
- "level transition" blueprint (level 1 transition to win level)
